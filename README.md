# SwiftCloud 

<h4>Created by MV</h4>

The #1 app for Taylor Swifties!  

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Testing:** Jest, Postman

## Getting Started

Before proceeding, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/)

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

 ```bash
 npm install
 cd src
 node app.js
 ```

## How to test the API

To test SwiftCloud API, use the following command:

1. **Unit tests**
Please be sure to test separately as it may interfere with each other in regards to database problems.

```bash
cd tests/unit
npm test feature.test.js
```

2. **Integration tests**
```bash
cd tests/integration
npm test feature.test.js
```

3. **Postman API Documentation**

## What I would do next?

Once SwiftCloud is ready, focus on thorough testing—unit, integration, and user acceptance—to ensure it works as intended. Finalize all documentation, including code, APIs, and user guides. Prepare for deployment by configuring environments, securing the app, and setting up CI/CD pipelines. After deployment, monitor performance, gather user feedback, and address any issues. Ongoing tasks include regular updates, customer support, and optimization, along with marketing efforts and legal compliance to ensure the app's success.
